# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio will be used to market my skills and education to potential employers. It will be added to and adjusted as my expertise and experience advance. Having a online portfolio will allow me to be able to showcase my best work as well as my progress and refinement to my craft and will provide a direct access to several different methods of contact.

## Usage
The user can click through active links in the menu at the top of the webpage to navigate to my different projects. The links in the 'contact info' section at the bottom page can be clicked to take the user to direct contact methods.

## Credits

As place-holders for future projects, I used popular websites. This is meant as a joke and not intended to imply that I actually had anything to do with writing the code on Airbnb or Google, or that I have ever had any working relationship with either of those companies at all.
