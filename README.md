# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio will be used to market my skills and education to potential employers. It will be added to and adjusted as my expertise and experience advance. Having a online portfolio will allow me to be able to showcase my best work as well as my progress and refinement to my craft and will provide a direct access to several different methods of contact.

## Usage
The user can click through active links in the menu at the top of the webpage to navigate to my different projects. The links in the 'contact info' section at the bottom page can be clicked to take the user to direct contact methods.
